Helen House,Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya,"First published January 1, 2022","I loved this little book!!! (It is really very little, at 66 pages the shortest book I've read all year.) The ending didn't quite click for me and I think I'll have to reread it in order to try and gain a better understanding of it, but everything leading up to it was phenomenal. Some of my favourite ever writing on grief and quite possibly my favourite lesbian protagonist I've ever read. As a fucked up grieving dysfunctional dyke, I just can't help but love other fucked up grieving dysfunctional dykes. Was sucked in by the raging lesbianism, stayed for the spooky creepy messed up in-laws. Can't wait for Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya's next book, whatever it's gonna be, and in the meantime I can't recommend her writing on Autostraddle enough. One of the best lesbian voices we have the pleasure of being able to read right now.","Horror, LGBT, Lesbian, Queer, Short Stories, Fiction, Romance",222,46,4.11,"1 star: 2 (<1%), 2 stars: 3 (1%), 3 stars: 41 (18%), 4 stars: 99 (44%), 5 stars: 77 (34%)"
