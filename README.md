# web-scraping-gr

Learning how to scrape websites using Goodreads!

gr-book-info creates a function that given a list of links from goodreads will scrape the title, author, primary genres, and other basic information about the book and save it in a dictionary

gr-reviews extracts the first 30 reviews of a given book and puts them into a list that can be exported into a csv

(practive.py is a file where I worked through an example to get a little more comfortable with beautiful soup)
